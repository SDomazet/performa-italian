**Ribbon** below the catalog menu contains action button *New course* (1) only visible to catalog administrators. The right side of the ribbon has icons for sorting and displaying the results as well as the magnifying glass icon (2) which opens and closes panel with search and filtering options. *Show deactivated educations* checkbox (3) is only visible to catalog administrator.

Courses
**********

When selected from the submenu, the **Courses** page is displayed to the user showing courses depending on user's application role and courses' visibility property. There are three types of visibility:

* **Public and self-enroll** - all users can see the course in the catalog and self-enroll to the course.
* **View only** - all users can see the course in the catalog but cannot self-enroll to the course.
* **Enrolled learners and owners only** - only enrolled users, course owners and catalog administrators can see the course in the catalog. If the current user is instructor in at least one course schedule, they will also be able to see the course.
