View System Logs
================

Application roles needed to view system logs: :ref:`Tenant Admin <tenant_administrator>`

#. In the **System settings** section on the **Manage** page click **Logs** tile.
#. System log records are displayed in table view. 
#. Each table row contains record details: id, time, level, error code, message and user id.
#. Results can be refined using filters and sorting. For example, user can choose to display only errors which occurred on particular day while they were logged in. In this case, column **Level** filter needs to be set to **Error**, **User id** must be set to administrator's id, and the date needs to be chosen from calendar picker control in **Time** column. Results can then be sorted from oldest to most recent by clicking the sort icon in **Id** column.
