About Learning Periods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Learning period represents a meaningful time period in which an organization considers learning activities. For a school, this might be a school year, and for a business organization, it will tipically be a fiscal year or a quarter. 

Learning periods are mostly used in reports and overviews. For example, a report will show all learner's enrolled courses and scores for a selected learning period.
